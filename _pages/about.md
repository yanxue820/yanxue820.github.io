I am currently a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Computer Science at Purdue University, working under the expert guidance of [Prof. Aniket Kate](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/akate/). In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, where I had the privilege of being co-advised by Prof. Dawu Gu and Prof. Shi-Feng Sun.

My research mainly focuses on applied cryptography, especially blockchain, secure computation and provable security. I am dedicated to designing efficient and secure cryptographic protocols that enhance collaboration while ensuring privacy protection. For more detailed information about my academic and research background, please refer to my [CV](/files/cv.pdf) and [research statement](/files/research statement.pdf).
