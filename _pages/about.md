I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Illinois Tech. Previously, I was a post-doctoral researcher at Purdue University, advised by [Aniket Kate](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/akate/). In 2022, I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao Tong University.


My research mainly focuses on applied cryptography, especially blockchain, secure computation and provable security. I am dedicated to designing efficient and secure cryptographic protocols that enhance collaboration while ensuring privacy protection. For more detailed information about my academic and research background, please refer to my [CV](/files/resume.pdf).

<p style="color:red">I am currently looking for highly motivated Ph.D. students to start in Spring or Fall 2026. Please see <a href="/files/Hiring.pdf">this flyer</a> for more details.</p>
